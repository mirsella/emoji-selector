got the emoji from https://gist.github.com/oliveratgithub/0bf11a9aff0d6da7b46f1490f86a71eb
quick shell one liner to write a emoji

with my DE i binded meta + ; to launch the script, because meta + shift + ; (meta+. on a azerty keyboard) is the key to open the default emoji GUI

dependency : rofi
but you can easily modify the line to use dmenu or fzf
